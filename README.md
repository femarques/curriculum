- *Redis* as distributed cache;
- *Flagr* as feature flagging solution;
- *Kubernetes* for container orchestration.

#### Key achievements

- Designed a free, non-blocking, distributed, plug-n-play monitoring solution that:
  - Captures and catalogues uncaught errors inside Flask/FastAPI applications;
  - Traces and correlates requests and logs across all monitored services;
  - Supports general leveled logging.
