## About me

Hi! I'm Felipe Marques da Silva, 29, and I live with my girlfriend and my 2 cats
in São Paulo - Brazil. Although I have a degree in Electrical Engineering by Universidade de São Paulo, 
I've being working as a Software Developer since I finished it. Most of my knowledge on software development was self-taughted, 
and I learned a lot from every place I worked.

I'm experienced on designing resilient and evolvable software architectures, and producing testable, 
extensible and maintainable Python code. I have solid skills on OOP, SOLID principles, AWS cloud services, 
software versioning, unit testing, HTTP APIs, and technical leadership.

I'm looking for an opportunity to work and live abroad, as it would provide a better quality of life for my
family, push me out of my comfort zone, let me know other cultures, and make some childish dreams come true.
